We build the base image using the Dockerfile, which validates the python requirements scaffolding that it copies from this directory. 

To update the requirements (`Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`) build and execute the image generated by `pipfile.Dockerfile` like so:

1. docker build -f ./pipfile.Dockerfile -t pipfile-generator .
2. docker run --rm -it -v .:/tmp/pip-airlock:Z pipfile-generator
3. Commit the newly-generated `Pipfile.lock` file (NB: this directory is in root .gitignore file, so you must `git add -f`)
